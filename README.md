# Scheduling / To-Do List App with CI/CD for DevOps

## App Name Ideas
- TimeKeeper
- ChronoTrack
- TaskTide

## Application Overview
This is a scheduling / to-do list application designed to help users manage tasks efficiently. It is developed using Express.js and EJS templates, and demonstrates the use of CI/CD practices in DevOps workflows.

## Core Features
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Priority markers (High / Medium / Low) with sorting
- Alarm / reminder for overdue or incomplete tasks
- Calendar view for task scheduling (optional extension)
- Daily task view (tasks due today)
- Task search functionality

## Objectives
1. **Prevent Broken Functionality**
   - Ensures tasks are correctly created, edited, and deleted
   - Priority values are assigned, sorted, and displayed correctly
   - Alarm and reminder logic triggers only when tasks are overdue

2. **Improve Development Speed**
   - Automated tests run after every GitHub commit
   - Errors are detected immediately during integration
   - Shortens troubleshooting time

3. **Improve Application Reliability**
   - Only code passing all automated tests is merged
   - Ensures a stable and reliable release process

## CI/CD Overview
- **Tools Used:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins (optional), Docker, Kubernetes / Docker Swarm, GitHub Copilot
- **Pipeline Flow:**
  1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
  2. CI pipeline is triggered
  3. Dependencies are installed
  4. Automated tests are executed
  5. Build is created only if all tests pass
  6. Docker image is generated
  7. Application is deployed using orchestration

## AI-Augmented Tool Usage
- GitHub Copilot assists with:
  - Suggesting test cases
  - Generating boilerplate code
  - Reducing syntax and logic errors
- Accelerates development and supports continuous integration

## Scalability, Availability, and Security
- **Scalability:** Multiple Docker containers; orchestration handles load
- **Availability:** Failed containers automatically restarted
- **Security:** Only tested code is merged; branch protection enabled; credentials stored securely

## Team Roles & Skills
- **DevOps Engineer:** Configures CI/CD pipelines and manages container orchestration
- **Backend Developer:** Implements task logic and alarm functionality
- **Frontend Developer:** Designs task views, priority indicators, and calendar UI
- **QA / Tester:** Develops automated test cases and validates CI pipeline results

## Strategy
- Features divided based on expertise
- All code changes must pass CI checks before merging
- Regular pull request reviews ensure code quality
- Encourages collaboration, accountability, and reduces merge conflicts

## Project Files

### `app.js`
- Main Express server file
- Configures routes for:
  - `/` → index page showing tasks
  - `/add` → form to add tasks
  - `/edit/:id` → form to edit tasks
  - `/delete/:id` → remove tasks
  - `/tasks` → optional page listing all tasks
- Stores tasks in a temporary array (for prototype)
- Handles form data parsing and redirects

### `views/` Folder
Contains EJS templates for rendering pages:

- **`index.ejs`** – Main dashboard showing task list with edit/delete links
- **`addTask.ejs`** – Form to add a new task
- **`editTask.ejs`** – Form to edit an existing task
- **`taskList.ejs`** – Optional page listing all tasks
- **(Optional)** `partials/` – Could contain shared header/footer templates

### `public/` Folder (optional)
- Place for static files such as CSS, client-side JS, and images
